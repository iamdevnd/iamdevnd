# 👋 Hey, I’m devnd 

🚀 **Applied AI & Full-Stack Engineer**  
I build **intelligent, scalable, and secure systems** that bridge **AI, cloud, APIs, and web**.  

I’m passionate about turning cutting-edge research into **production-ready solutions** — from LLM memory engines to encrypted note-sharing apps.

## 🔭 Current Focus  
### [⚡ ContextCache](https://github.com/iamdevnd/contextcache)  
The **ultimate structured memory engine for LLMs** — enabling persistence, explainability, and modular AI memory.  
- REST APIs built with FastAPI for structured retrieval & reasoning  
- Hybrid search (FAISS + PageRank + time-decay)  
- Graph-based storage with JWT-secured endpoints  
- Privacy-first, local persistence with modular APIs

## 🌟 Featured Projects  
🔐 [**NDSecure**](https://ndsecure.vercel.app) — Encrypted note-sharing app with AES-256 & self-destruct notes (React + Django REST + Docker APIs)  
🛡 [**KavachGuard**](https://github.com/iamdevnd/kavach) — Real-time NSFW detection in browsers with TensorFlow.js  
📊 [**Sentiment-Analytics**](https://github.com/iamdevnd/Sentiment-Analytics) — PySpark ETL + APIs for retail sentiment intelligence  
🧬 [**UMLS Detector**](https://github.com/iamdevnd/UMLS-Ontology-Inconsistency-Detector) — Biomedical ontology consistency checker with NetworkX  
🤖 [**Transformer Robustness Benchmark**](https://github.com/iamdevnd/Transformer-Robustness-Benchmark) — Stress-testing DistilBERT under adversarial stress
