## 👋 Hi there

I am a passionate researcher and developer specializing in **AI/ML, Social Computing, Machine Learning Security, Deep Learning, Knowledge Representation, Data Science, Data Mining, and Algorithm Engineering**. My work focuses on building explainable, modular, and secure systems to advance the state-of-the-art in artificial intelligence.

## 🚀 Current Focus

### **ContextCache – The Ultimate Structured Memory Engine for LLMs**
Persistent, explainable, modular AI memory with graphs, ranking, and full local control.

_ContextCache_ is my latest open-source initiative, designed to supercharge large language models with structured, persistent, and explainable memory. Harnessing graph-based storage, ranking algorithms, and modular architecture, ContextCache enables full local control and transparency—empowering developers to build smarter, safer, and more reliable AI systems.

- **Key Features:**  
  - Structured memory graphs for LLMs  
  - Persistent and local storage  
  - Explainable and modular design  
  - Advanced ranking and retrieval  
  - Privacy and security by design
