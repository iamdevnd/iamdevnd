Hi, there

🔹 Applied AI & Full-Stack Engineer | Passionate about building intelligent, scalable, and secure systems across AI, cloud, and web.

I work at the intersection of AI research and production engineering — transforming cutting-edge models into reliable, explainable, and high-performance systems. My expertise spans:

AI/ML → LLMs, RAG pipelines, FAISS, Transformers, PyTorch, TensorFlow

Backend & Web → FastAPI, Django REST, Spring Boot, Next.js, React

Cloud & DevOps → AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD

Security & Data → OAuth2/JWT, SQL optimization, observability (OpenTelemetry)

🚀 Current Focus
ContextCache

The ultimate structured memory engine for LLMs — designed to bring persistence, explainability, and modular control to large language models.

Hybrid retrieval: FAISS + PageRank + time-decay

Graph-based memory with reasoning endpoints

JWT-secured APIs + Typer CLI for management

Privacy-first, local persistence
