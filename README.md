Hi, I'm a passionate researcher and developer working at the intersection of AI/ML, web systems, and cloud-native engineering.

I specialize in LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), ML Security, Social Computing, and Knowledge Representation, with hands-on expertise in cloud-native architectures (AWS, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes) and full-stack development (Next.js, React, Django REST, FastAPI, Spring Boot).

My mission is to build explainable, modular, and secure systems that advance AI while staying production-ready.

🚀 Current Focus

ContextCache – The Ultimate Structured Memory Engine for LLMs
Persistent, explainable, modular AI memory with graphs, ranking, and full local control.

Structured knowledge graphs + FAISS vector search

PageRank + time-decay scoring for smarter recall

JWT-secured APIs and Typer CLI

Privacy-first design with local persistence
